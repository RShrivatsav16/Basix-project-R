# Basix-project-R
This R code simulates and analyzes insurance policies for different years, focusing on the impact of rainfall on payouts to farmers. Here's a brief summary of what the code does:

Setting Up Libraries: The code begins by loading necessary R packages, including `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization, along with other packages for specific functionalities.
Defining Functions: Functions are defined to simulate rainfall and calculate payouts for different policies based on rainfall conditions and premium payments.
2003 Policy Simulation: The code simulates rainfall for the 2003 policy, calculates the weighted rainfall index, and determines payouts for large, medium, and small farmers based on the rainfall conditions and premium payments.
Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analysis is performed by varying the target rainfall and premium values to assess their impact on net payouts. Results are visualized using line plots and density plots with ribbons to show the distribution of net payouts.
2004 Policy Simulation: Similar to the 2003 policy, the code simulates rainfall for the 2004 policy and calculates payouts based on the defined parameters. Sensitivity analysis is also performed for different premium values.
Visualization: The code generates ribbon plots and density plots to visualize the sensitivity analysis results, showing the distribution of net payouts across different scenarios and premium ranges.

Overall, the code demonstrates how to simulate and analyze insurance policies using R, considering various factors such as rainfall, premiums, and payout structures, and visualizing the results to understand their implications.
